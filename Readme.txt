This is a proof of concept of using [AngularJS] (http://angularjs.org)  in a ASP.NET MVC3 application, and for providing CRUD capabilities using JQuery and REST.  There is no ORM, no data layer: I have used System.Dynamic extensively to fake a repository.  Dynamics works so well with MVC3.


Also check out my CRUD proof of concept for   [knockoutjs] (http://KnockoutJS.com) at: [CRUD using Knockout] (http://harshbhasin.com/pages/15)
